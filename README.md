## Projections
This repository is a complementary material to our paper ["Projections onto the canonical simplex with additional linear inequalities"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03488), where we consider three such projections coming from the fields of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and accuracy at the top (AATP).

For a brief presentation, see the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/VaclavMacha/ProjectionsExamples/blob/master/examples.ipynb).
