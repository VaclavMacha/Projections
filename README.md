## Projections

This repository is a complementary material to our paper ["Projections onto the canonical simplex with additional linear inequalities"](https://arxiv.org/), where we consider three projections onto modified simplices coming from the fields of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and accuracy at the top (AATP). The repository consists of all algorithms proposed in the paper. For all those interested, a brief presentation of considered problems and of the functionality of proposed algorithms is available in the jupyter notebook with [examples]("https://github.com/VaclavMacha/ProjectionsExamples/blob/master/examples.ipynb"). Codes of the numerical experiments used in the paper are available in the [ProjectionsExamples]("https://github.com/VaclavMacha/ProjectionsExamples") package.
